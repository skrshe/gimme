# Gimme
gm - A wrapper around the whole git meta game

`gm domain/user/repo`

# Disclaimer
Why not rrir?!
- Im not to personally concerned with performance and security
    (I'm a minimiser (lazy arse procrastinator))
- I'd rather be able to easily tell what my progam is doing from the
    source code and have free reign over code styling and shapping.

- For people who do rrir props to you.
