# Gimme (GIt MetagaME)
gm - A wrapper around the whole git meta game

`gm domain/user/repo`

# !!! Disclaimer !!!
## Not yet under production
This project is yet to have a software release\
so far it is entirely hyperthetical

## Why not `RRIR`?!
- Im not to personally concerned with performance and security,
as I'm a minimiser (lazy arse procrastinator).
- I don't know rust

- For people who do `RRIR` props to you.

# Non goals

- constantly supply repeating output

    tree
        return a tree of repo
    spark

    log
