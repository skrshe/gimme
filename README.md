# Gimme (GIt MetagaME)
gm - A wrapper around the whole git meta game

`gm domain/user/repo`

# !!! Disclaimer !!!
## Not yet under production
This project is yet to have a working software release

## Why not RRIR?!
- Im not to personally concerned with performance and security
    (I'm a minimiser (lazy arse procrastinator))
- I'd rather have free reign over code styling and shapping.

- For people who do RRIR props to you.

# Non goals

- constantly supply repeating output

    git config aswell as domain specific config

        return a tree of repo
