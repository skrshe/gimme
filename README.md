# Gimme
gm - A wrapper around the whole git meta game

`gm domain/user/repo`

# Disclaimer
Why not rrir?!
    Im not to personally concerned with performance and security
    (I'm a minimiser (lazy arse procrastinator))
    i'd rather be able to easily tell what my progam is doing from the
    source code and have free reign over code styling and shapping.

    For people who do rrir props to you.
